            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>Our project is an interactive recipe microsite inspired by Domino’s Pizza’s UI/UX. The website will be a single-page application using only HTML and CSS, where users can interact with animated recipe cards. The site will rely on CSS transforms, transitions, and keyframe animations to create a visually engaging and functional interface without the use of JavaScript. The goal is to combine responsiveness, accessibility, and creativity into a cohesive design that demonstrates mastery of CSS animations.            </p>

              <li><strong>Sarah Barkire</strong> — I supported the project by helping brainstorm design ideas and suggesting improvements to the overall layout. I also assisted in selecting the color palette and typography to ensure the site had a consistent visual style. In addition, I created the PowerPoint slides that summarized our project and added input for the final presentation. I tested the website on different devices and provided feedback on navigation and usability, which helped refine the overall user experience.</li>
